# LEDcontroller

This is an archived project, for reference only. It is an eclipse project,
and as such, not very easy to transport between machines.

This is an implementation for WS2812 LEDs on a STM32F103 "BluePill" 
microcontroller. It comes with a firmware and a client to run on a PC, 
which accepts an OpenPixel connection (raw socket only) and sends commands
to the microcontroller to control the LEDs accordingly. 

The code in this project will be cleaned up and used as a base for code in
my main account @a-v-s.
